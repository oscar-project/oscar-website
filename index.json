In the field of innovative commercial software technology using Artificial Intelligence, DFKI is the leading research center in Germany.\nBased on application oriented basic research, DFKI develops product functions, prototypes and patentable solutions in the field of information and communication technology. Research and development projects are conducted in 27 research departments, nine competence centers and eight living labs. Funding is received from government agencies like the European Union, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK), the German Federal States and the German Research Foundation (DFG), as well as from cooperation with industrial partners. Twice a year, a committee of internationally renowned experts (Scientific Advisory Board) audits the progress and results of state-funded projects.\nApart from the state governments of Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Bremen, numerous renowned German and international high-tech companies from a wide range of industrial sectors are represented on the DFKI supervisory board. The DFKI model of a non-profit public-private partnership (ppp) is nationally and internationally considered a blueprint for corporate structure in the field of top-level research.\nDFKI is actively involved in numerous organizations representing and continuously advancing Germany as an excellent location for cutting-edge research and technology. Far beyond the country‚Äôs borders DFKI enjoys an excellent reputation for its academic training of young scientists. At present, approx. 890 highly qualified researchers, administrators and 610 graduate students from more than 65 countries are contributing to more than 390 DFKI research projects.

How can I decompress OSCAR Corpus files? Having a question or an issue with OSCAR?","tags":null,"title":"Frequently Asked Questions","type":"page"},{"authors":["Julien Abadji","Pedro Ortiz Suarez"],"categories":["news"],"content":"September 2021 marks an important milestone regarding OSCAR, and we have important news to share.\nNew pipeline tool The previous OSCAR corpus was generated by goclassy.\nThe latest (at the time of writing) and future ones will be generated by Ungoliant, a brand new corpus generation tool written in Rust.\nThe tool provides a more accessible Command Line Interface, with the following features:\nDowloading of CommonCrawl shards from a wet.paths file, Generation of a corpus from CommonCrawl shards, Deduplication, Splitting in files of fixed maxiumum size, Packaging (GZipping + checksum file creation) It is also possible (but not yet used/tested in terms of ergonomics) to use Ungoliant as a library.\nNew schema OSCAR is changing and will change again on the course of the following months/years, and as such it is important to provide a way to announce and specify schema changes.\nThe new OSCAR Corpus release follows the OSCAR Schema v1.1, enabling users to optionally get metadata extracted from CommonCrawl, while retaining backward compatibility, making the update from OSCAR 2018 to OSCAR 21.09 as effortless as possible.\nIn a gist, OSCAR Schema v1.1 adds \u0026lt;lang\u0026gt;_meta.jsonl JSONLines files that holds metadata. Each line has an offset and an nb_sentences field that can be used to get related lines in text files.\nNew corpus OSCAR 21.09 is the latest release of the OSCAR Corpus. The first to be generated by Ungoliant, and also the first containing metadata.\nNote that the data used to generate the corpus is from February 2021, but the next releases of OSCAR Corpus will try to narrow the gap between source data and corpus release.\nAnother important information is that there is no shuffled version anymore.\nIt is expected to be available during September 2021 via manual application through the Contact form of the website, and later on other platforms.\n","date":1630590355,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677087533,"objectID":"b14b90cb26f7528504366223e6832672","permalink":"https://oscar-project.org/post/news-21-09/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T15:45:55+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/news-21-09/","section":"post","summary":"New tools, metadata, and a fresh corpus.","tags":[],"title":"OSCAR News: September 2021","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julien Abadji","Pedro Ortiz Suarez","Laurent Romary","Beno√Æt Sagot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630676828,"objectID":"6d8be031bf26602ae3c68247d44cc66b","permalink":"https://oscar-project.org/publication/2021/cmlc9/ungoliant/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/cmlc9/ungoliant/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a new pipeline that is faster, modular, parameterizable, and well documented.
